# About

This repo contains a prototype for the UXCore Alert component updates from Q1 2024.

Branch `main` shows a simplified prototype of the final redesign.

Previous versions of the prototype can be found on the following branches:
* `alert-with-container-query`
* `alert-with-flexbox`

These previous versions show the old and the new alerts side-by-side.

They also have multiple settings which were no longer needed in the final version.
